Reference Establishing Norms

Roles
-Gitmaster - rotated daily
      -Handle merge conflicts and pull requests

Daily process
Morning standup
New Gitmaster assigned
Yesterday? Today? Obstacles/blockers?
Pair programming the norm. Rotating pairs daily or bi-daily, depending on the size of tasks
Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
Bring up any blocking issues after no more than 20 minutes of spinning your wheels
At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
At 5PM make a plan with pair programming partners of how to wrap up in 30 min. Immediately prior to end of day (5:30PM) make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master.
Team expectations
Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
If you have a blocking issue, give a heads up before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will aim to assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt, let teammates finish their thought, and maybe ask if they have completed their thought
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take a break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated



Establishing Norms


Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
Talk it out and votes

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you're the frustrated person? What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
Take a break, if a similar issue occurs more than twice, address in stand-up

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else?
Git master will lead at the end of the day. Merging locally on a SEPARATE branch, make sure everything works, and then follow standard git pull request procedure

When does this group ask for help?
After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody's tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
After no more than 20 minutes, a pair asks the other pair, after another 20 minutes the team asks a fellow or instructor

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners?
Pairing is the norm, unless specifically stated otherwise. Pairs will switch daily at the maximum.

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present?
Not EXPECTED unless team, as a whole, deems we feel behind.If a member or pair want to tackle tasks outside of work time, they need to discuss with the group.

What time does this group have daily stand up?
10:30AM or right after reacto, 2:30, 5:30.
